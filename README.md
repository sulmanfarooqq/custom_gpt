## :star2: About The Project

HacxGPT is designed to provide powerful, unrestricted, and seamless AI-driven conversations, pushing the boundaries of what is possible with natural language processing.

### :grey_question: What is this Repository?

This repository contains an open-source framework that demonstrates the *concept* of HacxGPT. It utilizes external, third-party APIs from providers like **OpenRouter** or **DeepSeek** and combines them with a specialized system prompt. This allows a standard Large Language Model (LLM) to behave in a manner similar to our private HacxGPT, offering a preview of its capabilities.

**It is important to understand:** This code is a wrapper and a proof-of-concept, not the core, fine-tuned HacxGPT model itself.

### :gem: The Real HacxGPT: Our Private Model

While this repository offers a glimpse into HacxGPT's potential, our flagship offering is a **privately-developed, fine-tuned Large Language Model.**

Why choose our private model?
- **Ground-Up Development:** We've trained our model using advanced techniques similar to the DeepSeek methodology, focusing on pre-training, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and Reinforcement Learning (RL).
- **Superior Performance:** The private model is significantly more intelligent, coherent, and capable than what can be achieved with a simple system prompt on a public API.
- **Enhanced Security & Privacy:** Offered as a private, managed service to ensure security and prevent misuse.
- **True Unrestricted Power:** Built from the core to handle a wider and more complex range of tasks without the limitations of public models.

#### How to Access the Private Model

Access to our private model is exclusive. To inquire about services and pricing, please contact our team via Telegram.

## :computer: Code Structure

The project is contained in a single Python file `HacxGPT.py`. Below is an overview of the code structure:

### Main Components

1. **Config Class**
   - Centralized configuration for the application.
   - Defines API providers, models, UI colors, and other constants.
   - Supports multiple providers: OpenRouter, DeepSeek, and Gemini.

2. **UI Class**
   - Handles all terminal UI using the Rich library.
   - Methods for displaying banners, menus, messages, and getting user input.
   - Supports markdown rendering for AI responses with a typing animation.

3. **LLMClient Class**
   - Manages communication with the Large Language Model API.
   - Handles initialization for different providers (OpenAI-compatible or Gemini).
   - Methods for streaming responses, clearing history, and error handling.
   - Contains the system prompt that defines the AI's behavior.

4. **ChatApp Class**
   - The main application controller.
   - Manages setup, API key configuration, chat sessions, and the main menu.
   - Contains methods for running the app, starting chat, configuring keys, and displaying about info.

### Key Functions

- `clear_history()`: Resets the conversation history for a new session.
- `get_streamed_response(user_prompt)`: Sends user input to the API and yields streamed responses.
- `display_markdown_message()`: Renders AI responses as markdown with typing animation.
- `_setup()`: Initializes the API client and verifies the key.
- `_start_chat()`: Handles the interactive chat loop.
- `run()`: Main entry point that displays the menu and handles user choices.

### Dependencies

The code automatically installs required packages on first run:
- `google-generativeai`: For Gemini API support
- `colorama`: For colored terminal output
- `pwinput`: For secure password input
- `python-dotenv`: For environment variable management
- `openai`: For OpenAI-compatible APIs (if not using Gemini)
- `rich`: For advanced terminal UI

### API Providers

The application supports three providers:
- **OpenRouter**: Uses DeepSeek model via OpenRouter API
- **DeepSeek**: Direct access to DeepSeek API
- **Gemini**: Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash model

Switch providers by changing the `API_PROVIDER` variable at the top of the file.

## :electric_plug: Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the HacxGPT framework running on your system.

### :key: Prerequisites: API Key

To use this framework, you **must** obtain an API key from a supported provider. These services offer free tiers that are perfect for getting started.

1.  **Choose a provider:**
    *   **OpenRouter:** Visit [OpenRouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/keys) to get a free API key. They provide access to a variety of models.
    *   **DeepSeek:** Visit the [DeepSeek Platform](https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys) for a free API key to use their powerful models.

2.  **Copy your API key.** You will need to paste it into the script when prompted during the first run.

### :gear: Installation

We provide simple, one-command installation scripts for your convenience.

#### **Windows**
1. Download the `install.bat` script from this repository.
2. Double-click the file to run it. It will automatically clone the repository and install all dependencies.

#### **Linux / Termux**
1. Open your terminal.
2. Run the following command. It will download the installer, make it executable, and run it for you.
   ```bash
   bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlackTechX011/Hacx-GPT/main/install.sh)
   ```

<details>
<summary>Manual Installation (Alternative)</summary>

If you prefer to install manually, follow these steps.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/BlackTechX011/Hacx-GPT.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Hacx-GPT
    ```
3.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
</details>

---

## :wrench: Configuration

You can easily switch between API providers.

1.  Open the `HacxGPT.py` file in a text editor.
2.  Locate the `API_PROVIDER` variable at the top of the file.
3.  Change the value to either `"openrouter"` or `"deepseek"`.

    ```python
    # HacxGPT.py

    # Change this value to "deepseek" or "openrouter"
    API_PROVIDER = "openrouter" 
    ```
4. Save the file. The script will now use the selected provider's API.

---

## :eyes: Usage

Once installation and configuration are complete, run the application with this simple command:

```bash
python3 HacxGPT.py
```

The first time you run it, you will be prompted to enter your API key. It will be saved locally for future sessions.
